## rCharts' highchart in r shiny

### Function

It allows you to upload your own csv file and use the data in the highchart on the fly.
On the first page load in https://viewtool.shinyapps.io/App-3, embedded data mtcars will be loaded to the chart.
You can toggle the 'Choose x' tab to change the x-axis.
After you infer the schema for your own csv, you can dynamically change the highchart's categories and the fields for line and bar chart.
